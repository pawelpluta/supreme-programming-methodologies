# Supreme Programming Methodologies

Extreme Programming Methodologies are nowadays used pretty common. It is very good, bringing joy to developer lives,
as it allows to produce software of better quality, and reduces costs within the company, as the amount of bugfixes that needs
to be deployed is significantly lower than during development without Extreme Methodologies. Unfortunately, after some time
of using them, you might ask yourself "Is there anything more I can do to make my software better?". Well, there is.

One day, some developers started to write names of new programming methodologies that they identified. As we already followed
Extreme Programming, we found out that they do not fall under this category. This is how Supreme Programming was born. By strong 
suggestion of our team member - T.G. - we decided to bring them to a broader audience, so also other, struggling teams 
can benefit from them. We care about developers, as we also are them, so we decided to describe those fascinating methodologies.

We believe that you already might use them, but do not know the proper approach. Review your knowledge, and bring these methodologies to live.
